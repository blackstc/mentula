# Project Mentula

Project Mentula is the collaborative effort between Yusef Marra and Charlie Blackstock. It was started to explore the agile development process, peer programming, and specific software technologies we both found interesting. It's intended to be on ongoing project with new applications being built regularly to expand our knowledge of new technologies.

## Cyber Tanks

Cyber Tanks is Project Mentula's inaugural undertaking. Built in under 3 weeks and entirely pair-programmed, Cyber Tanks is a multiplayer browser game that integrates Phaser, Express, Mongo, and Socket.io. The aim was to make an exciting and 'arcadey' game with a unique controller - your phone.

Cyber Tanks is currently considered to be at MVP status, in the near future we have plans to add small features like new powerups and different levels as well and large game-changing features like multiple views (which is in beta right now) so that you don't have to be in the same room with the other players.
